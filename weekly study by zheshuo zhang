After a week of struggle, the result is I have successfully installed Ubuntu 17.10 on Oracle VM VirtualBox(as a backup plan) and Ubuntu 17.10 on my external hard drive (which can boot from my PC with GTX 1080).

Ubuntu 17.10 TensorFlow on Oracle VM VirtualBox :

it was a simple process to install Ubuntu on a VM.
 
1. download VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/
install it
2. download Ubuntu image from
https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/
3. use Oracle VM VirtualBox to load the image
4. install TensorFlow with Virtualenv
follow instruction from https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#InstallingVirtualenv

and that's it

Ubuntu 17.10 TensorFlow-GPU r1.5 + CUDA 9.0 + cuDNN v7  with GTX1080GPU i5CPU 12gRAM PC:

It was a painful process, tried numerous methods, tried Ubuntu version 16.04 LTS version which has a conflict with GeForce GTX 1080, debugged all sorts of possibilities of sources of error. Tried different images; different USB to make the bootable drive; different hard drive to install the system on; integrity of the system etc. back and forth I install different versions of Ubuntu for over 30 times. But nonetheless here is the final solution for my PC. The following instructions are specified for GTX1080 or GTX1080ti

1.  Requirements:
a hard drive with a minimum of 16Gbs of  space for installing the system
a USB drive with a minimum of 8Gbs of space for burning the ISO image of Ubuntu on
2. Download Ubuntu image from https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop
3. use Rufus from https://rufus.akeo.ie/
to burn the ISO image to the USB drive
4. boot from the USB and install Ubuntu onto the hard drive following instructions from
https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop#4
5. start up the Ubuntu 17.10 system
Press Ctrl + Alt + T to open terminal
use the following command

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa          #install graphic card driver
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nvidia-384 nvidia-384-dev
sudo reboot                                               #reboot then open the terminal again

nvidia-smi                                                #verify the installation
                                                          #environment for CUDA9
sudo apt-get install g++ freeglut3-dev build-essential libx11-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev

sudo apt install gcc-6
sudo apt install g++-6

wget https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/9.0/Prod/local_installers/cuda_9.0.176_384.81_linux-run

chmod +x cuda_9.0.176_384.81_linux-run

sudo ./cuda_9.0.176_384.81_linux-run --override

#during the installation:

#login and download cuDNN v7.0.3 from https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/form/cudnn-download-survey

tar -zxvf cudnn-9.0-linux-x64-v7.tgz
sudo cp cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include
sudo cp cuda/lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda/lib64
sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn.h
sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn*

sudo bash
nano ~/.bashrc

#add following two line into bashrc
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/cuda-9.0/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}/usr/local/cuda-9.0/lib64:/usr/local/cuda-9.0/lib:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64

source ~/.bashrc

sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev python-virtualenv

virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/tensorflow

source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate

easy_install -U pip

pip install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu

although it took me about 30hrs to finally figure out how to install Tensorflow-GPU, the result was satisfying 

according to cifar10.py from TensorFlow tutorial for testing Tensorflow-GPU is 80 times faster than the VM TensorFlow on the same PC! 
the time I spend into making the GPU work was totaly worth it.
